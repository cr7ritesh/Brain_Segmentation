This is an image segmentation project in which Brain Tumor Segmentation is performed where we predict the tumor mask of the brain. This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks. The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The model used is U-Net. The final validation dice coefficient loss came out to be -0.89.
